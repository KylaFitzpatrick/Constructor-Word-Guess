# Constructor-Word-Guess

### About the app (i.e. what is it doing and why)
This a Word Guess command-line game using constructor functions. It uses constructors to concisely generate responses based on user input.

### High-level overview of how the app is organized

Node will run a word guess application and uses inquirer to prompt the user with question for guessing a random word and uses the Word constructor to store it

Inquirer prompts the user for each guess and keeps track of the user's remaining guesses

### Instructions on how to run the app

1. node index.js 

2. Follow prompts
